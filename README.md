# TAT Test Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General

The test task was completed in accordance with all the provided instructions.

I would like to highlight that in this project I used CSS Modules instead of the BEM methodology.  
The choice was made because CSS Modules provide several advantages:

- **Automatic scoping – styles are locally scoped by default, which prevents naming conflicts;**

- **Cleaner code – there is no need to create long BEM-style class names.**

Additionally, I made minor changes to the api.js file after discussing them in advance.

The website design was taken from free Figma templates.
